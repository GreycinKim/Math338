# Math338: Statistics Applied to Natural Sciences

The learning goals that this course aims for are:

o To learn basic techniques for exploring and describing data.

o To understand and appreciate the importance of how data are produced and the difference between experimental and non-experimental studies.

o To learn inferential methods, and to understand why/when they work.

o To gain experience in the use of relevant technology (e.g: RStudio/R/RMarkdown) and the ability to interpret outputs
generated by statistical software. Some of the main objectives include:
1. Reading/importing and manipulating data
2. Exploring data, visualizing, and generating descriptive statistics.
3. Simulating models/processes; computing probabilities for various distributions.
4. Construction of confidence intervals/Performing test of hypotheses.
5. Estimating model parameters (Distribution parameters/ Regression coefficients)
